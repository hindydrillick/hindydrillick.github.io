I am currently an Uhlenbeck Endowed Postdoctoral Fellow at [SLMath](https://www.slmath.org). I recently finished up my PhD at [Columbia University](https://www.math.columbia.edu) under the supervision of [Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin). My research mainly focuses on interacting particle systems and their scaling limits to solutions of stochastic partial differential equations.[subreddit](http://reddit.com).
